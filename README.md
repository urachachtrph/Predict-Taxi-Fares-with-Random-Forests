# Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests
This project I get its from DataCamp. The objective is predict the locations and times to maximize fares can be earned. The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong and will build a model using regression trees and random forests to predict.
